# Finite-Element-Analysis
Hi ! Hope you are doing great !

This is a finite element analysis project I made for school. The FEA methods are applied on 2D rectangles with an obstacle in the middle.
They are two different obstacles : a circular one and a rounded/oval one.
The circular case is done two times : one time with the regular method and one time by doing the integration with Gauss method and isoparametric triangular elements.


How to use the code :
First make sure that the files containing the coordinates and connectivities are in the same folder than the code.
Before running the codes, make sure that the import() functions import the coordinates in the variable "coordinates" and the connectivities in the variable "connectivity".
Finaly, click on run, the 3 plots should appears.

Thanks for reading and have a good day !
